## computerStore

This program is a school exercise designed to test how to make a website
using javascript, HTML and CSS.

The website (one page) imitates a simple computer store from where user can
select from three different computers to buy.

User can "make money" by pressing a button, take a loan(max 2*funds in the bank account)
and also pay back the loan. Loan can be taken only once before buying the computer.
